Let's simulate a traffic light. The light has to glow when clicked.

- The whole purpose of the component is displaying a traffic light with red, yellow and green lights.
- When any light is clicked (selected) it has to glow, but the other lights have to stop glowing.
- The component must have a hooked state variable that tracks the color
- Use the setColor function to change the color an the component will automatically re-render (because it's hooked with useState).
- Use the ReactDOM.render to render the component into the DOM like this
